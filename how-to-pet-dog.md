# How to pet a dog

Steps:
1. *Ask* the person if it is okay to pet their dog.
2. If the person says yes, approach the dog **calmly** with the back of your hand outstretched for them to smell. 
3. If the dog sniffs your hand and seems happy, you can pet them. 
4. Be prepared to stay there awhile. 

**CAUTION:** If you bring treats, you will have a new friend for life.

Now, go on and make new dog friends!
